   description: "Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Obito Uchiha) was a shinobi of the Konohagakure Uchiha clan and a member of the Minato team. It was believed that he died during the Third Shinobi World War, and that his only legacy was the Sharingan he gave him  to his friend Kakashi Hatake. In fact, Obito saved from death and trained Madara Uchiha, but due to the events of the war, Obito lost faith in reality and inherited from Madara his plan to create an ideal world. Reappearing under the names of Tobi  (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito secretly took control of the Akatsuki to use the organization as a manipulation tool to achieve his goals, and eventually made himself known by unleashing the Fourth Shinobi World War.  However, towards the end of the events of the war, Obito repented of his actions and, as an atonement, sacrificed his own life to save the world he had previously desperately tried to replace.",
