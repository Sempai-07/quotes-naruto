   neji: ["Luck never smiles on a ninja who seeks death from his own sword and demands the same from others", "People can't change.  That is why there are such concepts as genius and mediocrity.  Everyone judges by you, by your face, physical form and character.  There are things that cannot be changed.  People suffer and live with these factors.  Just like we cannot change the fact that you are from the main family, and I am from a secondary family.  My Byakugan has seen many things.  That's why I know it.  You are just trying to be strong.  In fact, you are thinking about how to escape from here.  You will not be able to deceive my eyes!", "If you put a ceiling in front of you, then you will never overcome it... Break all your walls and fearlessly take a huge step forward", "I don't believe in omens.  But the coincidences are already tired!", "Each person has his own path, and he must obediently follow it.  To end.  Only one fate destines for everyone without exception - death ", "Father, I'm not sure that the fate of a person is like a cloud flying in a stream from which it cannot escape, or that people are able to ride any breeze they choose.  I haven't figured it out yet, but maybe destiny doesn't care what you choose, it's just that when you choose your path, there is someone who walks beside you, going to live a full life.  There is real strength in this love of life, I realized this thanks to the last battle, father ", "People do not change!  Outcasts remain outcasts.  Neither character nor ability will change.  It is precisely because people do not change that there are such concepts as 'chosen ones' and 'dregs'.  People are judged ... by their appearance, intelligence, abilities, figure and character - by what remains unchanged.  People suffer from their shortcomings... and put up with them"],
