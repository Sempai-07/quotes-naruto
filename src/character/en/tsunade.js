   description: "Tsunade (綱手, Tsunade) is a descendant of the Senju clan and one of the Sannin of the Hidden Leaf. Known as the world's strongest kunoichi before Sakura surpassed her in sex, as well as the greatest medical ninja. Repeated loss of her loved ones  developed a fear of blood and forced Tsunade to give up the life of a shinobi for years, eventually being forced to return to Konoha as the Fifth Hokage (五代目火影, Godaime Hokage; Literally meaning: Fifth Shadow of Fire), where her skills proved invaluable  for the village.",
