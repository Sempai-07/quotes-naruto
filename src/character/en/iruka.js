   iruka: ["When someone dies, that's the end.  His past, present and future are gone.  Everything disappears, even dreams.  Even if the person was a valiant fighter like Hayate, the most important thing remains.  After all, the main thing is people.  Parents, loved ones, friends.  All those who were dear to him.  And all of them form a community of people who keep memories of him.  This is the unity of love, trust and self-sacrifice.  It gets stronger and stronger with time.  It's hard to explain, but we're all connected and it's very important to us.  This is how our life is arranged, all for the sake of a higher goal.  It's all for this.", "Yes...monster fox is like that... but Naruto is different.  I recognized him... one of my best students.  He may not be a hardworking worker...and he's clumsy and no one accepts him...but he already knows what it's like to feel pain inside your heart.  He's not a monster fox.  He is a resident of Konohagakure.  He is Naruto Uzumaki!", "Master Jiraiya praised only you.  He always bragged about you, saying that you were like his own grandson.  He believed that you would be the one to inherit his will, and truly believed that you would one day become a great Hokage.  Master Jiraiya will always watch over you.  Even at this moment, he is watching from somewhere.  He wouldn't be happy to see you sad like he is now.  So... Be your ordinary self, whom he appreciated so much.  Don't stay depressed forever.  For the sake of Master Jiraiya himself, one of the Legendary Sannin...I acknowledge you as his promising student!"],
